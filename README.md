# MailLogger

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joshmcarthur/mail-logger.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joshmcarthur/mail-logger)

You know how you're looking through your logs to see how your mailing is doing, and after all that request rubbish, you just can't see that **Sent mail** stuff? Annoying, right?

MailLogger to the rescue! It lodges a callback with `Mail`, capturing all of the mail being sent, and logging it to it's own file, so you can simply look back through that file to see what's up. Easy peasy!

I could be a pain and require Rails here, but I don't. If you are using Rails, then this gem should put things in the right place: `#{Rails.root}/log/mail_{development,etc}.log` - no extra work necessary. If you are not using Rails, then the gem will place the log file in `./log` - wherever that may be.

Default paths getting you down? Not to worry, this gem is configurable!

```ruby
Mail::Logger.configure do |config|
  config.log_path = "Whatever you want"
  config.log_file_name = "all my emails.log"
  config.include_body = true # false by default
end
```

(If you're using Rails, this belongs in `config/initializers/mail_logger.rb`)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'mail-logger'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mail-logger
    

> Please note: There's another project around called [**mail_logger**](https://rubygems.org/gems/mail_logger), which records details of mail to the database via ActiveRecord, instead of a log file (which is what this project does). While I certainly didn't intend to infringe, the other project hasn't been updated in a few years, so I'm sticking with this name.
